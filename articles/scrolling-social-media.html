    <h1>“Scrolling and Stressing?” How Social Media Affects Your Mental Health</h1>
    <p class="author">By: Ma. Coleen Rodriguez</p>

    <p>Why does every simple scroll bring anxiety and affect people particularly the youth instead of bringing them more entertainment? Shouldn't social media be a safe environment for entertainment, enjoyment and most importantly an Informational place for everyone? Yet in this generation many find it alarming that social media has major impacts on people especially the youth. Nowadays instead of being a safe and secure environment it has become a dangerous and risky place.</p>

    <p>You may wonder, what exactly are the reasons that social media became an alarming environment for most—well it is mainly about cyberbullying where many are criticized by the way they look, their lifestyle, race, and social status. Other reasons are online scammers who deceive the ones with little knowledge about technology and social media—and misleading information that also tends to cause issues among individuals that eventually escalates to an argument online.</p>

    <p>Now, how can this modern issue be handled properly? Through stricter allegations in social media platforms throughout the globe this issue has a chance of being lessened and controlled. Especially now that modern technology gives us the power to program and develop platforms easily. These allegations are a must to make social media an environment that is safer and more useful in modern times. As well as prevent mental health issues among younger individuals.</p>

    <p>Another is for preventing any misinformation that is against the law to enter any social media platform. By this the misunderstandings and misinformation will be handled properly. And no one else will have doubts about whether the information that they are looking for is right or wrong, again.</p>

    <p>And to conclude everything that has been stated—social media's effect on mental health is not a joke and should be taken action immediately by providing allegations and preventions across all social media platforms globally. By offering jobs to professionals that can be admins and look after social activity this problem has a chance of being stopped and controlled.</p>
