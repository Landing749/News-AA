      <h1>Editorial: Are Schools Failing to Stop Bullying?</h1>
      <p class="author">By: Athan Meir E. Obrero</p>

      <p>Every student deserves to feel safe in school, yet countless children face harassment, intimidation, and violence within the very walls meant to protect them. The Department of Education (DepEd) documented 11,637 bullying cases in public and private schools in 2019, before the pandemic disrupted in-person classes. Experts stress that this number is likely an undercount, since most victims never report their experiences for fear of retaliation or being ignored.</p>

      <p>The consequences are severe. A 2021 UNICEF Philippines study found that two in five Filipino students reported experiencing some form of peer violence, ranging from verbal abuse and physical harm to online harassment. Victims of bullying often display lower academic performance, increased absenteeism, and heightened risks of anxiety and depression. In extreme cases, bullying has been linked to self-harm and suicidal thoughts—issues already alarming in Philippine schools.</p>

      <p>Despite the passage of the Anti-Bullying Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10627), enforcement remains inconsistent. Some schools lack clear reporting channels, while others downplay incidents as “normal” behavior. As of 2022, the shortage of guidance counselors is stark: only 1,096 licensed counselors serve more than 20 million learners nationwide, according to DepEd data, leaving students without adequate support when they most need it.</p>

      <p>Bullying is not mere “kids’ play.” It is a form of violence that demands immediate intervention. Schools must strictly enforce anti-bullying policies, equip teachers to identify and address early warning signs, and provide safe, accessible mechanisms for students to report abuse without fear. Parents, too, must be active partners in recognizing and responding to the problem. Until these steps are taken, the question lingers: are schools truly protecting their students, or are they allowing bullying to remain a silent epidemic?</p>
